### arithmatic operators
#### - + / * %
like any prrogramming language
>output = x + y   
>output = x - y

and so on...
NOTE: if you want to use reminder dont use % like in C/C++/python 
you have to use mod func
bec % in matlab is used for comments
>output = mod(10,3)

>output = 1 

### Matrices operators
#### Addition and substractions
the matrix must have the same dimentions
>x=[1 2 3]; % x is 3 rows 1 coulmns

>y=[4 5 6]; % y is 3 rows 1 coulmns

>output = x+y

>output = [ 5 7 9]

you can use size() func to know the size of the array
>size(x)

>x = [3 1]
